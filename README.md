## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
   │
   ├── Firebase Authentication
   │
   ├── WebRTC (Audio / Video)
   │       │
   │       └── Socket.io Signaling Server
   │
   ├── Speech Recognition (Browser API)
   │
   └── Dashboard (Meeting History & Summaries)
```

> **Note:** Audio and video streams flow directly between peers. The server is used **only for signaling**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Authentication

* Users log in using Firebase Authentication.
* Successful login redirects to the dashboard.

### 2️⃣ Video Conferencing

* WebRTC establishes peer‑to‑peer audio/video communication.
* Socket.io is used to exchange offers, answers, and ICE candidates.

### 3️⃣ Live Transcription

* Browser Speech Recognition API converts speech to text in real time.
* Transcription auto‑restarts to ensure stability.

### 4️⃣ AI Summary (Conceptual)

* Meeting transcript is summarized using extractive techniques (demo).
* In production, transformer‑based NLP models can be used.

### 5️⃣ Dashboard

* Users can view past meetings and summaries in a centralized interface.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Start Signaling Server

```bash
node server.js
```

### 3️⃣ Start Frontend

* Open project using **VS Code Live Server**
* Open `login.html` in browser (preferably Chrome)

### 4️⃣ Start a Meeting

* Login → Dashboard → New Meeting
* Open meeting in **two browser windows** (normal + incognito)

---

## 🧪 Supported Browsers

* ✅ Google Chrome (Recommended)
* ⚠️ Firefox (Limited Speech API support)
* ❌ Safari (Not recommended for Web Speech API)

---

## 🎓 Academic & Viva Highlights

You can confidently say:

> “Platypus integrates WebRTC for peer‑to‑peer communication and AI‑based meeting intelligence to enhance productivity and knowledge retention.”

> “Speech recognition is implemented at the browser level for demonstration, while the architecture supports scalable AI models on the backend.”

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

* Multi‑user group meetings
* Speaker diarization
* Action‑item extraction
* Cloud‑based AI summarization
* Mobile application
* End‑to‑end encryption
